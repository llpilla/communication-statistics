    Computes multiple communication metrics/statistics over a given communication matrix.

    Parameters

    csv_file : string
        Name of the CSV file containing the communication costs matrix.

    ----------
    costs : np.ndarray
        Communication costs matrix.

    ------
    ValueError
        If the matrix contains NaNs, negative values, or if the matrix is not square.
